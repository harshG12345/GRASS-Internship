# overloading and overriding

""" Generally overloading is not supported in python. Because first function overwrite by second function.
    Method overriding is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method 
    that is already defined in its superclass.The method in the subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in 
    the superclass. When the method is called on an instance of the subclass, the overridden method in the subclass is executed
